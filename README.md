## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used www.w3schools.com and google images for the images. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Understanding the various JavaScript functions was one of the most difficult challenges I faced while developing this project.
I had a lot of fun making this game and learning how the various sections of the code communicate to make it work.
I am aware that I am always learning new concepts. It's easy to get frustrated because I don't understand the code right away, 
but I know that if I keep working my hardest, I'll get better. It is important to enjoy the journey rather than focusing exclusively on the destination.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Web development is a fascinating and enjoyable subject to study. 
I'm curious about how I can improve the look of my website, how React.js or Angular.js fit into the picture, 
how to deploy a website, what are some industry standards for website creation, 
how do I improve my web development skills, and how do I create websites like Amazon.com. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would try to tackle the remaining optional features that are mentioned above.
I would like to add a timer to the game so that the patterns continue to appear. 
I would like to keep track of the number of correct guesses and incorrect guesses.
When the timer runs out or the user makes three wrong guesses, the game is over.
There will be a feature to track the highest score. Additionally, I would like the game to have multiple levels. 
The higher the level, the more complicated the game will be.
